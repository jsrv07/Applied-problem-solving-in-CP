I have learnt a lot about competitive programming in this project and also how to approach and various method to solve a problem.
I am using CP handbook and the gfg pages given by the mentor as reference. 
the week wise problems given by the mentor focus on a specific topics and vary from week to week which help us to understand each topic better.
The topics i learned and used as week-wise are:
week1: Basic Loops, maths and number theory, recursion.
week2: Range queries, math logic.
week3: various questions on binary search.
week4: Binary search and partition problems.
week5: various questions on string.
and also using dp for some questions.
